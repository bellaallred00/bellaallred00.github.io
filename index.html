            <!-- write a paragraph explaining why your person is so great  -->
            <p>Superman is the greatest superhero because with his many super powers he can save multiple people at a time. </br></br> He was also always saving Lois Lane when people threatened her becuase she knew him. She was never able to get hurt because of him but he eventually died. </br></br> The super villian Doomsday ended up killing him and he was later revived by the justice league.
